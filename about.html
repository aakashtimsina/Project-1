            <p>Google isn't reinventing the wheel with the Pixel 7. It's a polished and refined upgrade to 2021's Pixel 6. The good news is that we already highly recommend that variant and its cheaper sibling, the Pixel 6a, and that remains the case when it comes to the newest model, and its new affordable companion, the Pixel 7a.

                Here you're getting the best possible Android experience, Google's Tensor-driven smarts, a terrific camera setup, and a few little refinements that improve the minor drawbacks of the predecessor (yes, the fingerprint sensor is far better).
                
                But (and it's a crucial but), this one costs £599 at full price while the very comparable Pixel 7a goes for £449. Are the iterative upgrades really worth a full £150 more? That's the big question.</p>
